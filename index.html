            <h1> My 3 fav Websites! </h1> 
        <ul> </ul>
        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse"> Netflix </a>
        <p>Netflix is an all time favorite because it has a good selection of shows and movies and it's cheaper alternative to cable. </p>
        <ul> </ul>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> YouTube</a>
        <p> Youtube is my favorite place to go to for random things like conispiracy theories, politics, learning how to make candles, and a whole array of other things.</p>
        <ul></ul>
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en"> Instagram</a>
        <p> Instagram is my favorite social media website, there's just more things to do compared to apps like twitter or snapchat.</p>
